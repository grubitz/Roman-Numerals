## Brief
Our client (Numeral McNumberFace) requires a simple API which will convert an integer to its roman numeral counterpart. After our discussions with the client, we have discovered that the solution will contain 3 API endpoints, and will only support integers ranging from 1 to 3999. The client wishes to keep track of conversions so they can determine which is the most frequently converted integer, and the last time this was converted.
 
### Endpoints Required
 1. Accepts an integer, converts it to a roman numeral, stores it in the database and returns the response.
 2. Lists all of the recently converted integers.
 3. Lists the top 10 converted integers.
